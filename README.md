## What the Project Does

This project is a hand gesture-based drawing application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using their webcam. By utilizing hand tracking technology from MediaPipe and OpenCV, users can control the drawing on the screen by simply moving their hands in front of the camera. The application provides options to draw in different colors and clear the canvas, all controlled through hand gestures.

## Why the Project is Useful

This project is useful for creating an interactive and touch-free drawing experience, making it ideal for creative activities, educational tools, or even just for fun. It can also be a great starting point for learning computer vision and hand tracking technologies. The touchless interaction is particularly relevant for maintaining hygiene, especially in shared or public environments.

## How Users Can Get Started with the Project
